# sorry_cmd_game
The Sorry game that was created in Command Prompt. This project was created during CS 250 class for the final. The code is not well-optimized since this is a college project. It might be compilable but this is created on a very old version for Microsoft Visual Studios (not sure what version at the time). <br/>
